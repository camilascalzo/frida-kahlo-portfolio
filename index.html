                <p>People call me the master of self-portrait. <br><br> This might be true. But I leave my soul in every canvas, not because of pride, but because I am often alone… so alone that I become the person I know best. I have no excuses. <br><br>
                People also call me surrealist, but I am not such a thing. I don’t paint my dreams (or anyone else's dreams) … I paint my reality. The reality of what my eyes see and my heart feels. <br><br>
                My paintings carry the weight of my own pain and miseries. They carry life as it is.
                I lost many things in my life, so they took that empty space and made it their own. <br><br>
                I used to think I was the strangest person in the world but then I realized there are so many people in the world, there must be someone just like me who feels bizarre and flawed in the same ways I do. I imagine they must be out there thinking about me as well.  <br><br>
                I hope that if you are out there and read this you understand that I'm here, I'm just as strange as you and I’m the right person for the job.</p>
